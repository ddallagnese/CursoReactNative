If you choose to access a United States Sagebin Account from other locations you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations, including both the laws of the United States and such other locations. If you travel to, or change your Sagebin Account as you may be permitted to, a different country or territory, you may not be able to re-download or stream content that was available to you in your previous country or territory, and if it is available, different terms of use, as well as additional charges, for such content may apply.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up an Sagebin Account</p>
<p>In order to use Sagebin, an Sagebin Account must be created. The Sagebin Account creator must be at least eighteen years old. If you are the creator of an Sagebin Account, you affirm that you are at least eighteen years of age, and are fully able and competent to enter into and comply with the Sagebin Terms of Use. When submitting information through Sagebin, including when setting up an Sagebin Account and when registering Members, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current, and complete information. You also agree to maintain and update the information you provide as required to keep such information accurate and up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registering Members</p>
<p>Your Sagebin Account may have a total of six authorized Members including yourself (each a &ldquo;Member&rdquo;). Each Member must be a natural person and will be assigned an access level by the person adding that Member. You can learn more about the rights and limitations of each available access level at the time you are asked to assign member permissions or by logging into your Sagebin Account at www.uvvu.com and reviewing the information in the &ldquo;Help and FAQ&rdquo; link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF YOUR SAGEBIN ACCOUNT ARE INDIVIDUALS WHOM YOU TRUST AND WITH WHOM YOU ARE COMFORTABLE SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN AND IN THE MANNER SET FORTH IN THE SAGEBIN PRIVACY POLICY) AND THE SAGEBIN RIGHTS PLACED IN THE SAGEBIN ACCOUNT. ONCE REGISTERED, EACH MEMBER WILL, SUBJECT TO PARENTAL CONTROL SETTINGS, HAVE ACCESS TO AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE ALL OF THE SAGEBIN RIGHTS STORED IN THE SAGEBIN ACCOUNT, REGARDLESS OF WHICH MEMBER OBTAINED THOSE RIGHTS ORIGINALLY. ADDITIONALLY, DEPENDING ON THE ACCESS LEVEL OF A MEMBER, THAT MEMBER MAY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADD AND REMOVE MEMBERS (INCLUDING THE PERSON ORIGINALLY CREATING THE SAGEBIN ACCOUNT), ADD AND REMOVE DEVICES, CHANGE MEMBERS&rsquo; PASSWORDS, CHANGE MEMBERS&rsquo; PROFILES AND ACCESS LEVELS, AND TERMINATE THE SAGEBIN ACCOUNT. IF YOU ARE REMOVED FROM AN SAGEBIN ACCOUNT YOU WILL LOSE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE SAGEBIN CONTENT IN THAT SAGEBIN ACCOUNT (INCLUDING ANY SAGEBIN CONTENT THAT YOU ORIGINALLY OBTAINED THE RIGHTS TO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parental Controls</p>
<p>Sagebin is not intended for use by children without the involvement and supervision of a parent or legal guardian. If a Sagebin Device or streaming service does not provide parental control settings, and parental control settings are important to you, you should not use such Sagebin Device or streaming service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BECAUSE A SAGEBIN ACCOUNT MAY CONTAIN RIGHTS TO EXPLICIT, VIOLENT OR ADULT CONTENT, PARENTAL DISCRETION AND UTILIZATION OF SAGEBIN&rsquo;S PARENTAL CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY AS WELL AS THE PARENTAL CONTROLS AVAILABLE ON YOUR SAGEBIN DEVICES AND THROUGH YOUR STREAMING SERVICES IS ADVISED FOR ALL MEMBERS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confidentiality and Passwords</p>
<p>Maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Sagebin Account is the responsibility of you and the other Members of your Sagebin Account. Each Member will have his or her own password, and each Member&rsquo;s user name/password combination will grant access to your Sagebin Account. You should select a password that is difficult to guess and not reveal your password to anyone else. BECAUSE A MEMBER MAY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MODIFY YOUR PASSWORD AND DELETE YOUR MEMBERSHIP IN YOUR SAGEBIN ACCOUNT, BE CERTAIN THAT YOU ONLY SHARE AN SAGEBIN ACCOUNT WITH INDIVIDUALS YOU TRUST. In the event of any breach of security, including unauthorized access or use of your Sagebin Account, immediately notify SAGEBIN LLC at contact@sagebin.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Sagebin&rsquo;s policies with respect to the collection, use and sharing of information are set forth in the Sagebin Privacy Policy, and, with respect to children under thirteen, also the Sagebin Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, both of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Please review our privacy policies, and if you are under the age of eighteen, review our privacy policies with your parent or legal guardian, to understand our practices. By accepting the Sagebin Terms of Use you are consenting to the Sagebin Privacy Policy and Sagebin Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viewing Sagebin Content</p>
<p>Once you or another Member obtains rights to Sagebin content from an Sagebin retailer, you may view that content on Sagebin Devices registered to your Sagebin Account and via authorized streaming services. You are aware and understand that by using Sagebin, you may have access to Sagebin content that may be deemed offensive, objectionable, unpleasant, or in the event, and that such Sagebin content may not be identified as such. You agree to use Sagebin at your sole risk and that SAGEBIN LLC will have no liability to you for your exposure to such content. If you are under 18 years of age or if parental controls are set with respect to your use, you understand that certain Sagebin content may not be available for download or streaming by you even if there are rights associated with such Sagebin content in your Sagebin Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Streaming Sagebin Content</p>
<p>Your Sagebin Account is authorized to receive a total of one stream of Sagebin content simultaneously. The Sagebin content that is available for streaming and the devices to which it may be streamed will vary depending on which authorized streaming services you elect to use in connection with your Sagebin Account. Depending on the type of streaming service you and the other Members of your Sagebin Account elect to connect to, such streaming service may be available for use by all Members of your Sagebin Account and without the need to separately log into your Sagebin Account, or the streaming service may only be available to a particular Member after that Member logs in to his or her Sagebin Account. Each streaming service supports its own devices so you will need to check with your streaming service provider to determine the devices to which you are authorized to stream Sagebin content. In connection with your use of streaming services you may be required to comply with additional terms and conditions of such third party service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Requirements and Administrative Access</p>
<p>Use of Sagebin requires Internet access and at least one Sagebin Device or device supported by a Streaming Service, and may require certain software and the obtaining of updates or upgrades thereto from time to time. You are responsible for any fees associated therewith. Because use of Sagebin involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use Sagebin may be affected by the performance of these factors as well as by changes in these technologies over time. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended. In addition, all Sagebin Devices may not support all of the features and functionality available for Sagebin. For example, to view high definition Sagebin content you will need a high-definition compatible Sagebin Device. You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be revised from time to time, are your responsibility. You further acknowledge and agree that SAGEBIN LLC is not responsible for failure in proper configuration or limitations of your Sagebin Devices. Sagebin is independent of such other products, services and offerings, and the purchase or obtaining of any such product, service or offering does not guarantee your access to the full features and functionality of Sagebin. In connection with the operation of Sagebin, SAGEBIN LLC will have administrative access to your Sagebin Account to provide customer service, maintenance and support, investigate complaints, and/or fix errors but shall not be obliged to do so at your request or otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Termination, Removal and Suspension of a Member or Sagebin Account</p>
<p>If for any reason you no longer wish to use Sagebin, you may remove yourself as a Member or, if your access level allows, terminate your entire Sagebin Account. Terminating your Sagebin Account will terminate access to that account and the Sagebin rights associated with it for all Members of your Sagebin Account. We will use efforts to retain your Sagebin Account information for ninety days after termination in case your termination was in error, however, we have no obligation to retain any of your Sagebin Account information and any such information, including any rights in your Sagebin Account, might not be restored. In sharing your Sagebin Account you are consenting to the termination of your Sagebin Account and your rights with respect thereto by any Member whose access level provides such account administration rights. If you elect to terminate your Sagebin Account or another Member, you are solely responsible for notifying the affected Members prior to such termination. SAGEBIN LLC assumes no liability for any failure by a Member to notify the other Members of an Sagebin Account prior to deletion of a Member or such Sagebin Account. If you wish to retain copies of the Sagebin content in your Sagebin Account prior to termination, you must download the corresponding content to an Sagebin Device or, if you obtained the rights to do so, obtain the content in a form of physical media, such as a DVD, prior to termination, in each case only as authorized by SAGEBIN LLC and the retailer from whom the rights to such Sagebin content were obtained and in accordance with SAGEBIN LLC&rsquo;s requirements and subject to any third party requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree that SAGEBIN LLC may, in its sole discretion and without notice to you or liability, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to part or all of Sagebin if SAGEBIN LLC believes you or a Member of your Sagebin Account are using or have used Sagebin in violation of the Sagebin Terms of Use or applicable law or regulations or in any manner other than for its intended purpose and in accordance with all other guidelines and requirements applicable thereto.

In addition, you understand that SAGEBIN LLC may modify or cease providing Sagebin or any portion of Sagebin at any time without notice. You agree that SAGEBIN LLC will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such restriction, suspension, or termination of your access to your Sagebin Account or rights to any Sagebin content.</p>
